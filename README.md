# Hydra - The simplest State Management Library for React

Introducing the simplest state management library for React.

## Objective of this project

Understanding redux for a newbie to React and connecting redux is a steep learning curve. To minimize that I wanted to write this project to make it more simpler for the new comers to Redux to understand the connectors and APIs more deeply so that they understand the edge and corner cases of the Library to help them code better scalable redux apps.

The project started as a learning project ot understand the depth and roots of redux and flux. Digging deep into the core files of these libraries I started writing my own state management library which is smaller and powerful

You can use this code as a learning material to understand the redux codebase how createStore, combineReducer, Provider , connect and bindActionCreators work in Redux or build your own.

Will be working on this for the next couple of month to minify the pitfalls of Redux and make better Error Handling cases for developers to debugg and understand the Redux workflow, Time Travel and Relay.

## Redux and React-Redux Parallels
In this project I wanted to cummulate both the APIs of Redux and also React Redux where we specificaly pick up the connector to make smart components in React. But in reality we always have to use the APIs of react-redux to make it truthfully work with redux.
This project is separated into Redux polyfills and React Redux polyfills which is connect via an API layer to make it optimized and compressed bundle.

To understand the core structure of Redux go through the Redux folder into the core and for React Redux go through the react-redux folder into the core files to understand their APIs on how they work under the hood in simpler ways. Check out the error handlers to understand more on the concepts where you can go wrong.


## Redux APIs
 * createStore
 * combineReducer
 * bindActionCreators

## React-Redux APIs
 * connect
 * Provider
