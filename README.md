# Hydra - The simplest State Management Library for React

Introducing the simplest state management library for React.

## Objective of this project
The project started as a learning project ot understand the depth and roots of redux and flux. Digging deep into the core files of these libraries I started writing my own state management library which is smaller and powerful

You can use this code as a learning material to understand the redux codebase how createStore, combineReducer, Provider , connect and bindActionCreators work in Redux or build your own.

Will be working on this for the next couple of month to minify the pitfalls of Redux and make better Error Handling cases for developers to debugg and understand the Redux workflow, Time Travel and Relay.

## RoadMap
 * Provider
 * connect()

## Download and installation instructions 
Coming Soon
