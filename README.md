# Hydra - The simplest State Management Library for React

Introducing the simplest and not yet another state management library for React.
The project started as a learning project ot understand the depth and roots of redux and flux. Digging deep into the core files of these libraries I started writing my own state management library which is smaller yet powerful..

You can use this code as a learning material to understand the redux codebase how createStore, combineReducer, bindActionCreators work in tandom.

I will scale this up as time permists. In the mean time if someone wants to contribute to this project feel free to open a PR.

**RoadMap:**<br>
1 — createStore() - Done<br>
2 — combineReducers(), <br>
3 — Provider and <br>
4 — connect()<br>
