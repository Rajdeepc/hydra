# Rex

Introducing yet another state management library written by and maintained by me.
The project started as a learning project ot understand the depth and roots of redux and flux. Digging deep into the core files of these libraries I started writing my own state management library which is smaller yet powerful..

You can use this code as a learning material to understand the redux codebase how createStore, combineReducer, bindActionCreators work in tandom.

I will scale this up as time permists. In the mean time if someone wants to contribute to this project feel free to open a PR.
