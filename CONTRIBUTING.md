## Docs
Improvements to the documentation are always welcome. You can find them in the docs path.


## Sending a Pull Request
For non-trivial changes, please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we won't want to accept.

On the other hand, sometimes the best way to start a conversation is to send a pull request. Use your best judgement!

In general, the contribution workflow looks like this:

### Open a new issue in the Issue tracker.
Fork the repo.
Create a new feature branch based off the master branch.
Make sure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.
Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.

## Thank you for contributing!
